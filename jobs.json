LUnion Economique et Montaire Ouest-Africaine (UEMOA) est partie prenante du projet et est le moteur de la mise en uvre du volet rgional. LObjectif de Dveloppement du Projet (ODP) est de renforcer la rsilience des communauts et des zones ctires cibles de lAfrique de lOuest. Les dfis du projet se situent  diffrents niveaux dintervention : au niveau des pays, au niveau transfrontalier et au niveau rgional. Le projet WACA ResIP sarticule autour de quatre (04) composantes: Cette composante concerne les institutions rgionales et les activits associes  leur intervention. Il sagit de renforcer lintgration rgionale en vue damliorer (i) la gestion des zones ctires  travers le soutien des politiques et des protocoles rgionaux labors  cet effet ; (ii) le renforcement des capacits dobservation des zones ctires et des systmes dalerte prcoce ; (iii) le dveloppement de nouveaux instruments daccs et de financement ; (iv) les changes de connaissances, le suivi-valuation au niveau rgional. Pour la mise en uvre de cette composante, lUEMOA coprside le comit rgional de pilotage (CRP) de WACA ResIP avec les pays ( tour de rle), en sappuyant sur les dispositions du Comit de pilotage du Programme Rgional de Lutte contre lErosion Ctire (PRLEC), initi en 2010 par lUEMOA. Assurant la maitrise douvrage de la Composante 1 sur lintgration rgionale du projet WACA ResIP, lUEMOA a sign un accord subsidiaire avec lUICN (Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature) qui est ainsi charge, en qualit de matre douvrage dlgu, de mettre en place et de coordonner le Bureau dAppui Rgional (WACA BAR) du programme. A son tour, lUICN a confi (i) les questions techniques lies  la ratification et  la mise en uvre des protocoles ctiers et marins, rgionaux et internationaux (sous-composante 1.2) au Secrtariat de la Convention dAbidjan (ABC) et (ii) celles relatives  lobservation ctire et lappui aux pays dans ltablissement et loprationnalisation des systmes dobservation ctire (sous-composante 1.3) au Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE) de Dakar. Les composantes 2, 3 et 4 sont excutes par les Units de Gestion de Projet (UGP) des 6 pays concerns: Cette composante appuie les pays dans llaboration et le renforcement des cadres politiques et rglementaires adquats et les outils ncessaires pour le dveloppement et/ou loprationnalisation de leurs stratgies et plans pour une gestion rsiliente du littoral,  lchelle nationale comme rgionale. Cette composante finance des investissements ctiers, ou sous-projets, visant  protger les zones et les populations vulnrables  lrosion et aux inondations ctires,  mettre en uvre des oprations de contrle de la pollution et de gestion des dchets, et  promouvoir le dveloppement ctier rsilient face au changement climatique et aux risques de catastrophes naturelles. Au niveau national, il est mis en place dans chaque pays une Unit de Gestion du Projet (UGP) et un Comit Technique (CT). LUGP assure la coordination et la mise en uvre des activits du projet et leur cohrence par un suivi rgulier. Le CT appuie lUGP dans lanalyse et la validation des diffrents rapports techniques produits dans le cadre du projet. Dans chaque pays, un comit de pilotage assure le suivi et fournit les consignes/marches  suivre pour les orientations principales du projet. Le projet rgional WACA ResIP a t prpar en reconnaissant le besoin daborder les questions de lutte contre lrosion et la pollution ctire sous une approche rgionale, car les chelles des phnomnes gomorphologiques en jeu dpassent les cadres nationaux. Ainsi dans le cadre du projet WACA ResIP, la prise en compte de questions transfrontalires est fortement encourage. Les activits et investissements ctiers, peuvent en effet avoir des impacts importants sur lvolution du trait de cte au-del des frontires du pays initiateur, et ainsi engendrer de lrosion dans les pays limitrophes. Il est pour cela indispensable de dvelopper des mcanismes de collaboration intertatiques. En Mauritanie comme au Sngal, des projets de dveloppement importants sont en cours ou envisags sur le littoral: ports  NDiago et port de Saint-Louis, entre autres. A cela sajoute lexploitation trs prochaine dun gisement de gaz qui est  cheval entre les deux pays. Or,  ce niveau, le littoral est fragile, constitu de roches meubles (sable et vasires  mangrove) et comprend une biodiversit remarquable avec la prsence dcosystmes humides rigs en Rserve de Biosphre Transfrontalire du Delta du fleuve Sngal (RBTDS) depuis 2005. Ce domaine frontalier (Figure 1) correspond aux secteurs ctiers MR4-c, MR4-d (Mauritanie) et SN1-a, SN1-b (Sngal) tels quils ont t dfinis dans le Schma Directeur du Littoral dAfrique de lOuest (SDLAO)[1]. Les secteurs MR4-c et MR4-d prsentent un cordon littoral trs troit (environ 200 m) bord en retrait par des zones inondables (Parc National du Diawling  PND, Chat Tboul, cuvettes de lAftout Es Saheli). Cest une zone trs instable, mme si le volume de la dune bordire est parfois consquent. Du fait de lvolution des enjeux (extraction du sable, prospection de ptrole et de gaz), la priorit dactions est passe de faible  modre entre 2010 et 2016 dans le SDLAO, tandis quun niveau de suivi/observation  rgulier  de la zone est identifi. En 2020, pour le bilan des littoraux en cours, le niveau de suivi/observation est lev   intensif et rgulier , entre autres,  cause de la construction du port de NDiago, le village du port et des alas  pollution  et  rosion ctire  qui restent importants sur le secteur. Figure1 : Emprise spatiale de la zone dtude pour le suivi du trait de cte et la gestion de lrosion ctire sur le segment transfrontalier sngalo-mauritanien (source: SDLAO, 2010) Les secteurs SN1-a et SN1-b prsentent une rosion rapide sur plusieurs sites, mais aussi des secteurs localement en accrtion. La reconfiguration de lembouchure suite  louverture de la brche de la langue de Barbarie en 2003 est toujours en cours avec des volutions touchant non seulement la faade maritime expose, la rive droite du bas delta du fleuve Sngal (PND et sa zone priphrique), mais aussi le  littoral intrieur  des berges du fleuve, avec une forte progression de lespace intertidal. Lvolution des enjeux sur ce secteur (projet de port et de dragage fluvial, mise en place de la route Saint-Louis  Rufisque, investissements en infrastructures pour lirrigation, projet damnagement touristique, dcouverte dun important gisement de gaz au large de Saint-Louis : 450 milliards m3) justifie la priorit trs leve et le niveau de suivi/observation intensif et rgulier affects par le SDLAO en 2010 et en 2016. Ces mmes niveaux sont maintenus dans le bilan 2020 en cours. Pour toutes ces raisons et en vue de prvenir les impacts probables des activits et des investissements sur lvolution du littoral et sur lintgrit de la cte, la Mauritanie et le Sngal ont prvu de signer un protocole fixant les modalits de partenariat pour la mise en place et loprationnalisation dun comit mixte, dans le cadre de la mise en uvre du projet WACA ResIP. Au titre des activits transfrontalires, les deux pays ont convenu, entre autres actions bilatrales, de raliser une tude commune (dnomme ltude) sur le suivi du trait de cte en vue de lutter contre le phnomne drosion ctire dans la zone frontalire sngalo-mauritanienne. Cette tude visera notamment  mieux comprendre les facteurs qui sous-tendent lrosion ctire et sa dynamique dans lespace transfrontalier et  proposer des mthodes de lutte contre lrosion, favorables pour les deux pays. Lobjectif global de ltude est de quantifier lvolution morpho-sdimentaire du linaire ctier transfrontalier et destimer son volution possible dans le futur en vue dorienter les politiques de gestion du risque drosion ctire sur le littoral sngalo-mauritanien. Cette tude se fera en parfait partenariat avec une quipe de consultants sngalais et mauritaniens qui travailleront conjointement sur le segment ctier frontalier. Cette tude permettra notamment aux deux pays de dvelopper un cadre et un mcanisme de suivi harmoniss, dfinis et oprationnels, ainsi quune base de donnes partages entre les deux pays sur laquelle des discussions politiques pourront tre engages. Dans un premier temps, les suivis envisags sorganiseront autour de plusieurs campagnes de caractrisation de lvolution morpho-sdimentaire, bathymtrique et hydrodynamique du linaire ctier transfrontalier afin den dterminer les zones en rosion svre ou susceptibles de prsenter une certaine vulnrabilit  lala rosion. Dans un second temps, il sera envisag une remdiation au phnomne par lapplication de mesures et de techniques de gestion  douces  et souples du trait de cte. Toutefois, leur mise en place ncessitera une tude approfondie permettant dvaluer leur faisabilit. Pour garantir la durabilit des suivis associs  ltude et la bonne mise en uvre des futures stratgies de gestion intgre du trait de cte, deux phases successives ont t identifies: Les prsents Termes de Rfrence (TdR) portent sur le recrutement dun consultant individuel international charg darticuler et de coordonner les travaux des quipes de consultants mauritaniens et sngalais mobilises pour la Phase 1 des tudes au niveau des deux pays. La Phase 2 sera ultrieurement prise en charge par une autre quipe de consultants, dans le cadre dune autre mission. LaPhase 1portant synthse et analyse critique des connaissances et des donnes existantes sur les dynamiques et volutions du littoral transfrontalier sngalo-mauritanien est une mission pralable indispensable  ltude. A la lumire du bilan qui sera dress  lissue de cette premire phase, des prconisations seront notamment formules afin de garantir un dispositif cohrent et durable de suivi du trait de cte en vue dclairer les politiques publiques dans leurs mesures de gestion, dadaptation et de lutte face au risque drosion ctire. LaPhase 1vise trois objectifs spcifiques  savoir: Il est attendu de ltude les rsultats suivants: Lensemble des outputs (rapports, notes, cartes, base de donnes SIG et mtadonnes) issus de cettePhase 1seront partags entre les deux pays, transmis aux deux UGP WACA ResIP et capitaliss pour tre accessibles aux dcideurs et aux chercheurs, notamment dans le cadre des observatoires nationaux et du futur observatoire rgional du littoral ouest-africain. Les rapports seront transmis au format Word (docx), les supports de prsentation au format PowerPoint (pptx), les cartes ainsi que les rapports et les supports sous format PDF (pdf). Les donnes SIG seront partages et structures par lintermdiaire dune base de donnes avec leurs mtadonnes associes, aux formats standards .shp, .tiff, .csv, et seront visualisables et exploitables sous le logiciel QGis. A la suite des changes avec certains partenaires, les UGP WACA ResIP du Sngal et de la Mauritanie ont dcid de confier laPhase 1 des consultants nationaux  mobiliser par chaque pays pour la ralisation de cet tat des lieux et diagnostic des tudes existantes sur le trait de cte transfrontalier. Ces consultants pays seront appuys par un consultant international recrut par le WACA BAR. Cette premire phase se dcline en trois tches successives. Les consultants nationaux auront entre autres pour mission de: Les consultants nationaux auront ici pour mission de dresser undiagnostic de lexistant lgard des tudes, des connaissances, des donnes, des structures de suivi et des mesures de gestion lies au littoral transfrontalier sngalo-mauritanien. Ce diagnostic sappuiera notamment sur les rsultats issus de la Tche 1.A et en concertation avec les parties prenantes. Une analyse critique et stratgique de typeSWOT(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats=Forces, Faiblesses, Opportunits et Menaces) sera ralise et permettra de: A la lumire des conclusions tires de ltat des lieux (Tche 1.A) et du diagnostic (Tche 1.B), des recommandations seront enfin formules par les consultants dans lintention de perfectionner les moyens matriels, informatiques et humains, ainsi que les capacits techniques (formations) des parties prenantes pour complter, optimiser et prenniser les connaissances et les donnes sur le littoral transfrontalier sngalo-mauritanien. Des prconisations en matire de campagnes dacquisition de donnes, de traitement, de valorisation et de partage de ces donnes, seront notamment formules pour enrichir et actualiser les connaissances actuelles des chercheurs et des techniciens, des populations riveraines comme des dcideurs locaux, sur les dynamiques et volutions de leur littoral. Les consultants sattacheront par consquent  proposer une mthodologie oprationnelle, partage et prenne de suivi du trait de cte, en prcisant les responsabilits de chaque partie prenante (institutions et structures tatiques, universits, observatoires nationaux du littoral, observatoire rgional du littoral ouest-africain) et les cots estimatifs, dans lobjectif dassurer la bonne mise en uvre et loprationnalisation de la deuxime phase de ltude. Il sagira plus spcifiquement ici de dfinir un cadre et dispositif de suivi durables du trait de cte dans la zone transfrontalire, notamment: En vue daccompagner et orienter les politiques de gestion du risque drosion ctire sur le littoral sngalo-mauritanien et sur la base de ltat des lieux / diagnostic des mesures et outils de gestion existants pour les deux pays (planification, rglementation), les consultants proposeront galement des orientations afin dengager leur harmonisation et leur alignement en faveur dune action transfrontalire intgre, partage et cohrente. Chaque pays recrutera son consultant national pour effectuer toutes les tches numres ci-dessus et le Bureau dAppui rgional de WACA ResIP mobilisera un consultant international dont la mission sera de coordonner lharmonisation et larticulation des deux processus mens au niveau national. Ce consultant international, qui travaillera en parfaite synergie avec les consultants nationaux, sera charg dassurer la bonne coordination de toutes les tches et activits prvues dans ces tudes.

TGH se rserve le droit de mettre fin au processus de recrutement ds quun candidat est positionn Acteur dune solidarit durable et partage Cre en 1994, TGH, association franaise de solidarit internationale base  Lyon, labore et met en uvre des programmes durgence, de rhabilitation et de dveloppement dans les domaines de leau, de lhygine et de lassainissement, du gnie civil, de la scurit alimentaire, moyens dexistences et du dveloppement rural, du socio-ducatif et du psychosocial. TGH travaille actuellement dans 10 pays dAfrique, dAsie et du Moyen-Orient. La Rpublique centrafricaine (RCA) compte aujourdhui plus de 2,8 millions de personnes ayant besoin dassistance, soit plus de la moiti de la population que compte le pays. Les besoins prioritaires regroupent laccs  la nourriture, la protection, laccs aux soins de sant,  leau potable,  lassainissement et lhygine,  lducation, mais galement laccs aux abris et aux articles mnagers de premire ncessit. Si les besoins primaires des populations augmentent, les affrontements rguliers rendent difficile laccs  laide humanitaire aux populations dans le besoin, et donc le travail des organisations humanitaires sur place. Considre comme lun des pays les plus pauvres au monde, la RCA traverse des crises humanitaires rcurrentes depuis son indpendance en 1960. Cette situation est en partie la cause, mais aussi la consquence, de la faiblesse de lEtat et de linstabilit politique chronique, souvent  base ethnique, qui secouent rgulirement le pays. Depuis mars 2013, les changements de rgimes qui se sont succd ont contribu  une escalade des violences intercommunautaires dans le pays, multipliant les violations des droits humains, les dplacements massifs de populations ainsi que la destruction de biens et la perte des moyens de subsistance de ces dernires. A cet gard, le Comit permanent inter-organisations a hiss la crise centrafricaine au niveau 3 de lurgence humanitaire, ce dernier tant le plus lev. Depuis fin dcembre 2020, le droulement des lections prsidentielles a impact la situation scuritaire du pays. 6 groupes arms se sont ainsi runis pour crer la Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC) et lutter contre la tenue de ce scrutin. Aprs que Faustin-Archange Touadra ait t rlu ds le premier tour (au pouvoir depuis 2016), la CPC a accentu ses initiatives afin de prendre le contrle du pays et notamment de la capitale, Bangui. Le climat de tensions instaur par les lections prsidentielles de dcembre 2020 perdure encore aujourdhui, bien que les forces armes centrafricaines (FACA) soutenues militairement par leurs allis russes et rwandais ainsi que par la MINUSCA  pu reprendre le contrle dune partie du pays. En juillet 2023, lEtat en place a organis un rfrendum pour modifier la constitution pour celle-ci puisse permettre au prsident en place de se reprsenter  vie. Le oui a largement emport, bien que lopposition ait appel au boycott. TGH est prsente dans la prfecture de la Vakaga. Zone du nord est, frontalire avec le Soudan et le Tchad, la Vakaga fait face  des difficults accrues: son isolement gographique se traduit galement par un isolement social, politique et conomique, vis--vis du reste de la RCA et principalement de Bangui. Ltat y est peu prsent et le redploiement des services officiels demeure pratiquement inexistant. Ainsi, nombre de fonctionnaires dcentraliss de lEtat sont bass  Ndl, chef-lieu de la Prfecture voisine de la Bamingui-Bangoran. Du fait de son isolement, la Vakaga a t la dernire des 16 prfectures de la RCA  recevoir son prfet. Nomm le 23 aot 2017 par le prsident Faustin-Archange Touadra, il a pris ses fonctions le 21 fvrier 2018. En aot puis octobre 2019, des affrontements entre groupes arms ont eu lieu  Birao ce qui a engendr le dplacement de plus de 15 000 personnes dans des sites de regroupement dans la ville et crant des besoins trs importants en eau, hygine et assainissement ainsi quen aide alimentaire. Faisant face  la volatilit du contexte scuritaire, la MINUSCA, opration multidimensionnelle des Nations Unies en charge de la protection des civils, de la facilitation de laide humanitaire et du soutien au processus de transition est prsente  Birao. . Les mesures ncessaires sont prises par TGH en consquence. Enfin, depuis le dbut de la crise au Soudan en avril 2023, la situation en Vakaga sest dautant plus dgrade: la frontire est dornavant ferme (alors que la zone tait largement dpendante du commerce avec le Soudan) ce qui a rduit la disponibilit des biens sur les marchs et fait largement augmenter les prix. Les rfugis Soudanais et retourns centrafricains affluent, pesant encore davantage sur le peu de ressources disponibles. Enfin, la condition scuritaire se dgrade, avec la prsence de groupes arms tchadiens et soudanais. TGH a dbut son action en RCA en 2007 pour soutenir les populations vulnrables de la prfecture de la Vakaga. Aujourdhui, lassociation intervient en Vakaga ( Birao et sur les axes) dans les secteurs de la Scurit Alimentaire et Moyens dExistence, de lEau, Hygine, Assainissement et de lEducation/Renforcement de Capacits   travers un projet multisectoriel financ par lAFD en consortium avec PUI qui elle, intervient en Bamingui-Bongoran. A ce jour, TGH reste encore lune des seules organisations humanitaires internationales prsentes de manire continue dans cette rgion marginalise et excentre. Rcemment, afin de rpondre  lafflux de rfugis li  la crise soudanaise, TGH a obtenu de nouveau financement dUNCEF pour une rponse durgente multisectorielle en EHA, Protection de lenfance et Education sur Birao et sur les axes, pour rpondre  entre autres  au besoin des populations dplaces venant du Soudan (depuis avril 2023). Paralllement, lassociation met en uvre un projet multi-annuel ans le secteur de la formation professionnelle en consortium avec Mercy Corps financ par lAFD  Bangui, Mbaki et dans rgion ouest du pays (Carnot, Berberati, etc.). De plus, a Bangui, TGH intervient depuis 2014 auprs des enfants des rues, et depuis 2020 auprs des mineurs incarcrs pour garantir aux enfants marginaliss un accs  des services socio-ducatifs et mdicaux de base, et participe au processus de runification familiale et de placement en famille daccueil. Lintervention de TGH vise  amliorer la protection et la rinsertion des enfants en situation de rue, et mineurs incarcrs/librs; elle est finance par lAFD, UNICEF, les fondations RAJA et UEFA ainsi que le CDCS. TGH a longtemps t prsente dans la Ouaka, mais faute de financement, la base de Bambari a t ferm en juin 2022.

La mission est finance  hauteur denviron 3,5 millions deuros.

We deliver critical insights, data, and tools to support informed policy, program, and financing decisions. This knowledge helps to secure safe water and sanitation for vulnerable populations, improving human health and well-being. Aquayas portfolio spans public health, economics, technology development, and social entrepreneurship in over 20 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We have published or contributed to over 40 peer-reviewed research articles and produced numerous other reports and publications. Aquaya maintains an office in Nairobi, Kenya, and Accra, Ghana. Staff members are also in the US, France, Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Morocco. Many of our projects are carried out in collaboration with academic research groups and expert consultants. We are recruiting multiple Senior Research/Program Managers (Senior Managers) to support ongoing research programs. These full-time positions are preferably based either in Ghana or Kenya and require extensive travel across Africa. The Senior Managers will be responsible for managing research program activities, including, but not limited to: Program/project management Research management The Senior Manager is anticipated to support a variety of research projects, including but not limited to: WaterTRACS The Water Testing, Research, and Capacity Strengthening (WaterTRACS) program includes two primary interrelated components: (1) water quality data collection and analysis at the community, household, school and health care facility levels and (2) a fellowship program that provides resources and opportunities to cultivate a pipeline of skilled water professionals (additional details here). For five years (2021-2026), this initiative is committed to leading water quality monitoring and trend analysis at the community, household, and institutional levels in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Uganda. Collaborations with local universities, laboratories, and government stakeholders are central to this effort. The program generates statistically representative data on water quality to rigorously inform strategies to improve water safety. Water Quality Assurance Fund Aquaya launched the Water Quality Assurance Fund (Assurance Fund) in 2020, a mechanism that incentivizes professional, urban laboratories to provide testing services to dispersed, rural water systems. In the event that a water system is unable to pay testing fees within one month, the Assurance Fund pays the fees on its behalf. The Assurance Fund thus, assures the laboratory that it will not suffer losses due to the non-payments of testing fees. Additionally, to encourage improvements in water safety management, the Assurance Fund program provides capacity building and technical guidance to water operators as well as engagement activities with consumers. Aquaya is currently implementing the Assurance Fund in Ghana and Kenya, and evaluating its impacts on water safety management via randomized, controlled trials. We also have prospects to introduce the Assurance Fund in Uganda and Tanzania in 2024.
