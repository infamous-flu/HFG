            <h1>Hackathon for Good: Wavemakers Project</h1>
            <p>
                Over the course of this hackathon we have looked at a lot of different datasets related to the level of access to water in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                We started with data from the United Nations regarding <a href="https://www.sdg6data.org/en/tables">SDG6</a>.
                From this data we were able to use python to create several maps.
                The geographical data for making these maps was taken from the GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries/blob/master/data/countries.geojson">geo-countries</a>.

                We also looked at data collected by the OECD regarding development assistance.
                The values given are adjusted for inflation based on the value of USD in 2017.
