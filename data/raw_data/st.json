According to the WASH-FIT assessment that was carried out by the WHO from September to November 2021 in Sao Tome and Principe, 100% (40) of the health facilities assessed in the country do not have adequate WASH infrastructure. Without this basic element, healthcare facilities cannot guarantee adequate hygiene of daily procedures, equipment, and staff... increasing the risk of infections and communicable diseases spread among patients and staff. Access to WASH in schools helps reduce children drop off and absenteeism, improve schools’ performance and increase/promote gender balance.\n\nThe WHO, UNDP and WFP is jointly implementing a project called Green Infrastructure for Health and Education in Sao Tome and Principe. The joint program will contribute to improved water and energy access in the health and school facilities, further contributing to improved quality in health, school feeding and education sectors in Sao Tome and Principe. By addressing better access to quality and safe health services, through improved clean energy supply (hybrid solar photovoltaic systems with corresponding generators and batteries for lighting and abstraction of water from boreholes or wells), water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in 7 district health care facilities (WASH), the programme will contribute to accelerating universal health coverage, the linchpin for all SDGs health related targets. Additionally, it will provide the country with a more sustainable and environmentally friendly school feeding program in 20 schools, powered by renewable energies and able to deliver daily nutritious hot meals to more than 5 000 school children 180 days per school year (adequate preparation and preservation of food), while also creating new market dynamics for 20 smallholder producers.\n\nThe WASH component of the joint project will be implemented by WHO. WHO will work with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and its institutions to guarantee accessibility of quality and safe healthcare services in the 7 district health centers in Sao Tome and Principe. This project will strengthen the foundation for primary healthcare and reduce delay in using services and hence is an essential component to a comprehensive support to improve health outcomes, and for social and economic development of the country.\n\nThis will be achieved through:\n\n1. Construction / rehabilitation of WASH infrastructures in 7 healthcare facilities (HCF)\n\n2. Provision of critical and essential WASH supplies\n\n3.
