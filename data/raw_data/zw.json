It develops and maintains relations with sub-region-wide institutions including Regional Economic Integration Organizations (REIOs). It assists the FAO Representations (FAORs) in the sub-region with addressing sub-regional food security, agriculture and rural development issues at country level. The Sub regional Office is a subsidiary of FAO’s Regional Office for Southern Africa.\n\nIn southern Africa, agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors in times of climate-related disasters, with long-lasting effects to livelihoods, food and nutrition security and the economy. Over the past year, the region has experienced extreme climate-related hazards with adverse impacts on agriculture, food and nutrition security. Large parts of central and... western southern Africa experienced their lowest seasonal rainfall totals since 1981, and the region overall received less rainfall during the 2018/2019 season than during the 2015/2016 when there was an intense El Niño episode. The drought affected most countries of the region with Angola, Botswana and Namibia declaring drought disasters. Concurrently, weather systems of Cyclones Idai and/or Kenneth hit the Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe early 2019, resulting in devastating floods. As a result, some 41.5 million people are food insecure in 13 out of the 16 SADC member countries.\n\nBecause of their dependence on rain-fed agriculture, the smallholder farmers were most affected by the drought, significantly reducing their 2018/19 production. With consumption-based coping strategies not as resilient as they once were, the cumulative effects of up to three consecutively poor harvests in hotspot areas of Southern Africa have been detrimental for agricultural-based livelihoods and will continue to drive down crop and livestock production – deepening food and nutrition insecurity and crippling economic gains. The impacts of the drought have eroded the capacity of smallholder farmers to produce in the coming 2019/20 season, with potential negative food and nutrition outcomes in 2020 and beyond. It is against this backdrop that there is need within the Sub Region to shift focus from solely a rain fed agricultural system to improving and expanding land and water resources management with view to increase agricultural productivity and protect livelihoods and coping strategies of the general populace.
