    "description": "WSUP is a non-profit partnership between the private sector, NGOs and research institutions focused on solving the global problem of inadequate water and sanitation in low-income urban communities. WSUP brings lasting solutions to low-income areas by working in partnership with service providers, including water utilities, local authorities and businesses, and the communities they serve. WSUP strengthens the capacity of service providers to deliver sustainable city-wide water and sanitation services, promote good hygiene and raise the environmental standards of low-income communities.\n\nFrom incorporation in 2005, WSUP has grown rapidly to a £10?12m organisation and has plans for further expansion over the next five years. The organisation is now at a pivotal stage in its growth. It presently operates six well?developed, respected country programmes in Africa and Asia (Bangladesh, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Zambia) to strengthen public and private sector service providers to... improve the delivery of affordable services to low income consumers WSUP has recently expanded its portfolio of operations to include the building and strengthening of private sector provision in urban water and sanitation services and the sale of consulting services on all aspects of low income urban WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) to disseminate learning and increase impact. All of these operations are supported by research, communications, funding and finance and resources teams.\n\nFor more information about WSUP's vision and approach, see\n\nIntroduction\n• Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) is a tri-sector partnership between the private sector, civil society and academia that brings local and global expertise together to deliver water and sanitation services, and promotes improved hygiene, to the urban poor. WSUP supports the development of situation specific models and establishing stronger links between multiple stakeholders to mobilize investment finance for pro-poor service scale-up. It achieves this through supporting the adoption and replication of effective, sustainable and scalable models of pro-poor urban water and sanitation services by service providers, local and/or national governments. WSUP operates globally and in Ghana, it has programme offices in Kumasi and Accra, with key focus on project sites within these cities.\n• WSUP is working with the Ga West Municipal Assembly (GWMA) to improve sanitation services delivery, and has supported Ga West in the development and launch of a 5-year compound sanitation implementation plan to increase access of toilets to low-income communities; the plan is referred to as “Toilet in Every Compound”. The objective of the plan is to create access to safe compound toilets for 80,000 residents by 2019.\n\nBackground\n• The current enforcement management for environmental sanitation regulation as defined under the Expanded Sanitary Inspection Compliance Management and Enforcement (ESICOME), a national-level programme guideline, entails:\n• the provision of bylaws to regulate behaviour;\n• an inspection system for checking compliance;\n• sanctioning mechanisms for failure to comply; and\n• a system for conflict resolution (facilitation / mediation role).\n• In Ga West, the enforcement of environmental sanitation regulations is not fully compliant with the ESICOME provisions and therefore makes enforcement ineffective.\n• Overall, the GWMA has not been able to translate the NESSAP (National Environmental Sanitation Strategy and Action Plan), as well as its MESSAP (Municipal Environmental Sanitation Strategy and Action Plan) and the ESICOME on the ground through the existing enforcement model.\n\nAssignment Objectives\n• The overall objective of this consultancy assignment is to build the capacity of Ga West’s EHSD to implement the compound sanitation strategy, and this will include (1) strengthened capacity to enforce relevant sanitation bylaws, (2) strengthened capacity to implement the 5-year compound sanitation implementation plan, and (3) strengthened capacity to better manage, report, motivate, receive feedback and enable staff to perform their duties.\n• A further objective of the assignment is to engage the Ga West Human Resource Department and the EHSD to review EHSD staff performance indicators.\n\nQualification Required & Experience\n• The assignment will require as key-staff:\n• one (1) Team Leader (Public/Environmental Health Specialist);\n• one (1) Public Sector Performance Improvement Specialist; and\n• any other experts deemed necessary by the consultant.\n• The Team leader should possess at least a Master’s Degree in a relevant topic (e.g. Community Development, Public Administration, etc), with at least five (5) years of experience in providing capacity building support to Environmental Health And Sanitation Departments of MMDAs.\n\nLocation: Accra\n\nBidding\n\nHow To Apply For The Job\n• Request for full RFP: We invite interested consultants to request the full version of the RFP from the contact below.\n• Submission of Proposals: We invite interested consultants to present technical and financial proposals to the (same) contact below before Monday 10th August, 2015.\n• Contact email address:\n\nwsupghana@wsup.com\n\nOr Call Us Tel\n\n0500-437015 / 0249-536815\n\nClosing Date: 07 August, 2015",
