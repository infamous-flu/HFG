This area is home to nomadic pastoralists whose livelihoods are at risk due to violent cattle raiding and the effects of climate change (drought and flooding). This part of Uganda also suffers from fragmented markets, chronic underinvestment in public services, and a lack of private sector investment. This Activity is aligned with the Water and Development II (WADI II) scope to access critical technical services in support of the U.S... Government’s Global Water Strategy, Global Food Security and Strategy Refresh, Agency Climate Strategy, and the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience; and is a cornerstone of the USAID Uganda (2022) Country Development Cooperation Strategy Development Objective (DO) 2, Resilient Growth Enhanced. The activity aims therefore aims to achieve results under the following development objectives:\n\nImprove water supply and integrated water resource management.\nIncrease equitable access to sanitation and hygiene services for households and schools.\nImproved agriculture-based livelihoods.\nIncreased consumption of nutritious foods among women and children.\nExpanded access to financial resources for women, men, youth, indigenous people, and marginalized groups.\nImprove local capacity to manage shocks and stressors.\n\nFtF WFSRCA will enhance market systems, strengthen relevant institutions, expand access to climate-resilient services, and—in two of the most vulnerable of the 20 districts covered by the activity—employ “graduation” approaches to assist the ultra-poor. These initiatives will incorporate conflict sensitivity, local leadership, climate change adaptation, and approaches inclusive of women, youth, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and indigenous groups.\nRole’s Purpose:\nThe Grants Assistant will support the project’s grants portfolio. The Grants Assistant will support help the design and management of the grants funds. S/he will be responsible for adherence to the project’s Field Operations Manual (FOM), USAID regulations, contract requirements and limitations, grant policies, procedures, controls, and reporting systems.
